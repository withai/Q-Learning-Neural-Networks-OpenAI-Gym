# Q-Learning using Neural Networks in OpenAI Gym 

Overview
========
Q-Learning is one of the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. In this tutorial we are going to deploy the variant of Q-Learning using neural networks for mapping state space to action space experimented on OpenAI Gym "FrozenLake" environment.

You can find an excellent tutorial on Q-learning using Neural Networks by Arthur Juliani [here](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0).

Dependencies 
============
* Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy
* OpenAI Gym (https://gym.openai.com/docs/)
* Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

Credits
============
Most of the conceptual and programmatic understanding is borrowed from the Reinforcement Learning Series by Arthur Juliani [here](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0).
